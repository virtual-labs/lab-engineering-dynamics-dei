    "introduction": "A fundamental topic in engineering mechanics, engineering dynamics examines how bodies move in response to forces and moments. By offering real-world and virtual experiments on subjects like moment of inertia, rolling motion, energy and momentum conservation, rotational motion, vibration, and motion under gravitational and resistive forces, the Engineering Dynamics Laboratory aims to enhance theoretical understanding of dynamics. These experiments help students bridge the gap between classroom theory and practical engineering applications by allowing them to visualize dynamic behavior, validate basic laws, and hone their analytical and problem-solving abilities.",
